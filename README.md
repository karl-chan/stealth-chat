# Stealth Chat

Yet another (secure) chat app

*Shhhhhh... even more than Signal!*

## Why?

- [X] Host your own server
- [X] **NO** phone number required
- [X] Camouflaged login screen
- [X] ... which prompts for your password, on **every** app start / resume
- [X] ... and derives your encryption key on-the-fly (`scrypt`), never persisted on device
- [X] Messages are shown once only, then erased
- [X] ... unless you save them before they disappear
