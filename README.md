# Stealth Chat

Yet another (secure) chat app

*Shhhhhh... even more than Signal!*

## Why?

- [ ] Host your own server
- [ ] **NO** phone number required
- [ ] Camouflaged login screen
- [ ] ... which prompts for your password, on **every** app start / resume
- [ ] ... and derives your encryption key on-the-fly (`scrypt`), never persisted on device
- [ ] Messages are shown once only, then erased
- [ ] ... unless you save them before they disappear
